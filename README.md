Overview

This addon enhances the mesh selection workflow in Blender by allowing you to select geometry on the back side of meshes without switching to X-Ray or Wireframe mode. It implements a Modo-style selection system that saves time and reduces unnecessary clicks during modeling.
Key Features

    Dual Selection Modes: Left-click selects only front-facing geometry, right-click selects both front and back geometry

    No Mode Switching: Work efficiently without constantly toggling X-Ray or Wireframe modes

    Multiple Selection Tools: Switch between Rectangle and Lasso selection methods

    Customizable: Configure to use middle mouse button instead of right mouse button

Configuration

After installation, you'll need to configure the right mouse button (RMB) settings:

    Optionally, set up a shortcut to toggle between Rectangle and Lasso selection modes
